# VueJs 3 Booking
VueJS 3 booking form during my experiment with:
* Filtering large JSON files by divide & conquer, filtering is made on the background with service worker. Used [Simple Service Worker](https://github.com/israelss/simple-web-worker).
* VueJS 3 composition API for state management
* v-Calendar for calendar ranges
* Handle rules for rooms and passengers
